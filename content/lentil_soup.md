## Directions

1. Cut up 1/2 onion, 1 carrot, a few mushrooms. Cut up garlic and put separately.
2. Wash about 1/2 cup lentils 3 to 4 times, until water is fairly clear.
3. Heat up olive oil in a pot. Add onion, carrot, and mushrooms and fry for 5-6 minutes until soft and starting to brown.
4. Add garlic, 1 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp cumin and cook for 1 minute.
5. Add lentils and ~6 cups water or broth.
6. Bring soup to boil and then reduce heat to medium low. Simmer for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.
